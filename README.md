# STM32F446RE_Drivers
Peripheral drivers for STMf446xx MCU that I've developed from scratch (bare metal NO STM32 HAL).
 
The actual drivers are located in 010STM32F446RE_Drivers/Drivers/.

These drivers are specifically developed for STM32F446 MCU

This is not an attempt to "reinvent the wheel" nor do i claim that this runs "faster" or "better" than the existing manufacturer HAL. 

This instead is my way of learning the inner workings of an MCU or even the inner workings of HALs (Hardware Abstraction Layers)

/*********SUPPORTED DRIVERS************/
1. GPIO Drivers 
2. SPI Drivers
3. I2C Drivers
4. USART/UART Drivers


Depending on my project needs in the future, I might add more peripheral drivers.
