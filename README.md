# STM32F446RE Peripheral Drivers
Custom peripheral drivers for the STM32F446 microcontroller, developed using a bare-metal programming approach without relying on the manufacturer's Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL).

This is not an attempt to reinvent the wheel nor do i claim that this runs faster or better than the existing manufacturer HAL. 

This instead, is my way of learning the inner workings of an MCU or even the inner workings of HALs (Hardware Abstraction Layers)

# SUPPORTED PERIPHERAL DRIVERS 
1. GPIO Drivers 
2. SPI Drivers
3. I2C Drivers
4. USART/UART Drivers


<br>Depending on the project needs in the future, I might add more peripheral drivers.
